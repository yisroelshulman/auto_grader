Write a program that takes one, or two integers as command line arguments and does the following.
If one integer was passed as the command line argument the program should sum all numbers from 0 to
the integer and print the result. If two integers were passed ex. 1, 10, the program should sum the
integers from the 1 to 10 and print the result.


note: The endpoints are included in the sum.


restrictions: the two integers are restricted as follows:
     -1,000,000 <= to the two integers <= 1,000,000


examples.

    for the input 1, 8, print 36.

    for the input 100, print 5050.
