Palindromes as defined in the oxford english dictionary are: "a word, phrase, or sequence that reads
the same backward as forward."
In other words strings that when ignoring non alphabetical characters and their case read the same
backward and forward.

Write a program that takes a string of any length as a command line argument and prints true if the
string is a palindrome, otherwise the program prints false.

Examples.
"A man, a plan, a canal, panama." the program should print true.
"radar", the program should print true.
"hello", the program should print false.
"the art of code.", the program should print false.
