The fizz buzz problem is a famous cs problem and is as follows.
print the numbers 1 - 100 (inclusive) with the rules that if the number is divisible by 3, print
Fizz if the number is divisible by 5 print Buzz if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 print
FizzBuzz. If non of these conditions are true the print the number.

Example: The first 16 numbers in the sequence would be.
1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16


The challenge here is to write a program that takes either 0 or 4 command line arguments.

if there are 0 args then the program should output the same as the classic fizz buzz problem.

if there are 4 args the args will have the form int1 string1 int2 string2. where int represents a
prime number and string represents the string that would would replace numbers divisible by the
prime number in the sequence 1 - 100 and numbers divisible by both int1 and int2 should be replaced
by string1string2.

Example the classic fizz buzz problem can also be represented by the args:
3 Fizz 5 Buzz
Example:  for input args 5 hello 7 world the sequence would look like this:
1 2 3 4 hello 6 world 8 ... 34 helloworld 36 ...


Notes:
The prime numbers are restricted by p < 20.

If the program is called with an invalid number of arguments the program should print: 
"invalid number of args".
If the program is called with non primes the program should print:
"not primes"
